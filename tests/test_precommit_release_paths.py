"""Every hook script must trigger the aos-precommit release that ships it.

aos-precommit-release.yml filters on `paths`. A hook whose script is absent
from that list goes stale silently: fixing the script alone cuts no release,
moves no tag, and consumers pinned to rev=aos-precommit-vX.Y.Z keep running
the old copy with no signal. Sibling of the agentic-os#187 rev/hook-list
invariant, filed as agentic-os#1148.
