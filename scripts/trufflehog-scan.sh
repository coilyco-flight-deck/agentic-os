# Offline secret scan for the catalog pre-commit suite. See agentic-os#288.
#
# Wraps `trufflehog git file://.` with a path-exclude list so a trufflehog build
# that walks untracked working-tree files (its git source reads gitignored dirs
# like Rust `target/`, upstream trufflesecurity/trufflehog) cannot drown the
# scan in build-artifact false positives and block every commit fleet-wide.
#
# --exclude-paths (a regex file) is load-bearing over the inline --exclude-globs:
# only exclude-paths filters the git source's synthetic working/staged diff by
# path. --exclude-globs filters committed git-log objects alone, so it does NOT
# suppress the untracked-file read that causes the block (verified empirically,
# agentic-os#288). The regex set mirrors agentic-os-kai's CI trufflehog scan.
#
# Real staged-secret detection is untouched: only conventionally-gitignored
# build/cache dirs are excluded, and a secret anywhere else still fails the scan.
