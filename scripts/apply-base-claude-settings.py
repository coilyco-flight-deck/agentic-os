"""Apply public-safe base preference keys into ~/.claude/settings.json.

Holds the fleet-wide, public-safe Claude Code settings keys that every host
gets regardless of whether the private bridge overlay is present. Auto-memory
is off because point-in-time memory drifts. Claude in Chrome is denied because
browser computer-use should be an explicit session opt-in. The permission deny
list keeps live-infrastructure CLIs and the memory directory out of an agent's
raw shell, and the wildcard allow drops the prompt on everything the deny list
leaves open.

Additive and key-scoped: it sets only the keys it owns and preserves every
other key verbatim, so the harness, ward, and the bridge merge can all keep
touching the same file. Idempotent, stdlib only, atomic write. Run by the
claude-hooks ansible role on every host.

Usage:
    scripts/apply-base-claude-settings.py            # write the merged settings
    scripts/apply-base-claude-settings.py --dry-run  # print the result, do not write
