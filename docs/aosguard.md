# aosguard

`aosguard` is AOS's guarded operator CLI. umbra and specgen remain generic,
while AOS owns this concrete policy snapshot, release name, and integration.

Packaged `specgen` discovers the [guardfile project](../.specgen/README.md),
materializes generated Go out of band, and emits `aosguard` without committed
Go build glue. Dev-base and native AOS releases build from the same source and
lock. Homebrew and Scoop install it beside `aos`.

## Authority boundary

The snapshot carries Forgejo, AWS, kubectl, Tailscale, Actions, SigNoz, and
runner-token leaves. AWS SSM permits single reads, file-backed writes, and
named deletions. Actions lives at `aosguard ops actions` so its exec transport
does not shadow `aosguard ops forgejo`. The sibling
[`forgejo-storage measure` bridge](forgejo-storage-measurement.md) uses fixed
`kubectl exec` operations from an embedded script invoked by absolute path.
`aosguard ops signoz` reads only the converged SigNoz MCP server. The snapshot
excludes Ward role policy.
Forgejo pin actions are fixed to a single tracker where coilyco-ops holds admin.
The ordinary Forgejo wrapper keeps bot auth. The admin wrapper reads
`FORGEJO_ADMIN_TOKEN` from the environment, so credentials never enter argv,
logs, or tracked files.

The attended wrapper carries repo settings, org labels, topics, and branch
protection: [aosguard-forgejo-admin](aosguard-forgejo-admin.md).

Ward's fixed broker and AOSguard's static operator surface are independent.
Specgen merges AOSguard policy into one static binary. Neither surface imports
role-derived grants from the other.

## Generated skill

Specgen renders one concise native skill plus a complete lazy command index:

```text
aosguard/SKILL.md
aosguard/references/commands.yaml
```

The full image builds those files beside the binary. `aos --guarded` projects
the skill into the selected agent's skill root. In warded mode, AOS also puts
the binary under the generic bundle's `bin/` directory. Ward mounts it
read-only after the image's PATH, so it cannot shadow an image tool.

The skill grants no permission. The running `aosguard --help`, nested group
help, and `describe` surfaces remain authoritative.

## Source ownership

`.specgen/guardfiles/aosguard/` owns the operator policy, vendored Swagger
inputs, and generated API locks. Ward owns its broker internally. Neither
product reads policy from the other, and no drift check forces them to match.

The Forgejo source is vendored from the pruned deployment contract, so
`aosguard-lock` refreshes the dependency graph without reaching a live Forgejo
edge. The source Swagger and its generated API lock use deterministic gzip at
`forgejo.swagger.v1.json.gz` and `forgejo.swagger.lock.json.gz`. Specgen
decodes each before use. The resulting `specverb.lock` pins umbra for
reproducible builds.

Specgen no longer emits per-member Markdown. `aosguard-lock` instead refreshes
the native skill under ignored `dist/skills/`, while maintained product
documentation stays under `docs/`.

## Development

`ward exec aosguard-build` materializes `dist/aosguard` and refreshes the
generated skill. `ward exec aosguard-run --` passes subsequent arguments to the
generated command. `ward exec aosguard-lock` is the only lock-writing step and
uses the packaged `specgen` executable.

Cross-repository composition is tracked on the intake tracker, with AOS
implementation in [agentic-os#755](https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os/issues/755).
