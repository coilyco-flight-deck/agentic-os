# dev-base auto-bump

The dev-base tier Dockerfiles pin every tool as a hand-edited `ARG`
([docs/dev-base-image.md](dev-base-image.md)). `release.yml` republishes the
image on every push to main, but nothing kept those pins current, so the
published image silently drifted behind upstream until a human edited an `ARG`.
That is the ward#288/#301 incident (agentic-os#272): headless agents kept hitting
a bug already fixed upstream because the image they ran predated the fix.

## What runs

[`.forgejo/workflows/dep-bump.yml`](../.forgejo/workflows/dep-bump.yml) runs
daily (and on `workflow_dispatch`). It calls
[`scripts/dep-bump.py`](../scripts/dep-bump.py), which resolves each pinned tool
against its upstream latest release, and for every pin that drifted commits a
single `ARG` bump and pushes to main. That push republishes the image through the
same `publish-image` job as any other push to main, so `:latest` tracks upstream.

The bump logic lives in this repo because the publish pipeline does (AGENTS.md).
Fleet rollout is not its concern.

After the planned bumps are applied, the workflow runs the same gate as release
before it pushes, so a bad pin leaves the run red and stops before `main`.

## Properties

- **Auditable, not silent.** One commit per tool
  (`chore(dev-base): bump UV_VERSION 0.11.21 -> 0.11.24`), so history shows every
  bump and a bad one bisects to its own commit.
- **Conservative bumps.** Node and the .NET SDK track the latest release of their
  currently-pinned major (no surprise major jump - the SDK stays on the .NET 10
  channel eco-app's mods build against, agentic-os#329); uv, go, aws-cli, claude,
  mcporter, codex, goose, gh, helm, kubectl, yq, docker, tailscale, trufflehog,
  and ward track the latest stable upstream release.
  Tailscale resolves against its `pkgs.tailscale.com/stable` feed (not GitHub
  tags, which interleave the unstable odd-minor releases); ward resolves against
  its Forgejo tags list (it lives on Forgejo, not GitHub, and the image builds it
  from source at that pinned tag - agentic-os#223). A hand-edited `ARG` wins until
  upstream passes it.
- **Two deliberate opt-outs.** `GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION` and `KDLFMT_VERSION` have
  no resolver, so the auto-bump never touches them (agentic-os#292). Their lint /
  format output is version-sensitive, and the in-container gate has to match the
  version the consuming repos' CI pins (cli-guard + ward pin golangci-lint
  v2.12.2; ward pins kdlfmt v0.1.7). Auto-bumping them to upstream latest would
  re-drift the container gate from CI - the exact failure the bake-in closed.
  Bump them by hand when the consumers move. `docker buildx` and `wasm-pack`
  stay job-local for the publish and language-specific workflows, so dev-base
  does not claim them.
- **Fail-soft.** A resolver whose upstream is unreachable or has reshaped its API
  drops from that run with a warning; it never blocks the other bumps.

## Running it locally

- `ward exec dep-bump -- check` - drift summary, exit 1 if any pin is stale.
- `ward exec dep-bump -- plan` - the stale set as TSV (`--json` for machines).
- `ward exec dep-bump -- apply --arg UV_VERSION --version X` - rewrite one `ARG`.

## Republish token

The workflow pushes with the auto-issued job token by default, which is enough on
a Forgejo that enqueues workflow runs from bot-token pushes. If your Forgejo
suppresses them (the guard GitHub applies to prevent recursion), the bump lands
but `publish-image` never fires. Set the `DEP_BUMP_TOKEN` Actions secret to a
`coilyco-ops`-owned `write:repository` PAT so the push is attributed to a real
user and enqueues `release.yml`;
[`scripts/rotate-dep-bump-token.sh`](../scripts/rotate-dep-bump-token.sh) mints
and sets it (mirrors the `REGISTRY_TOKEN` rotation in dev-base-image.md).
