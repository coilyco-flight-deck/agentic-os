doc_goal: Define the reduced AOS to Ward integration boundary.

# AOS and Ward boundary

Ward owns fixed workflow commands, container isolation, lifecycle, repository
workflow mechanics, and its fixed broker. AOS does not ship a Ward role bundle.

The only Ward-consumed AOS file is [`.ward/ward.yaml`](../.ward/ward.yaml). It
declares repository development commands, the AOS image and release channel,
and the repository landing workflow. `ward doctor` validates that YAML through
Ward's loader.

## Ownership

* Agent-compose owns behavioral roles, seats, identity, personalities, and
  composed skills in [`.agents/roles.kdl`](../.agents/roles.kdl).
* AOS owns the selected harness, concrete launch tuning in
  [`harness_launch_profiles.json`](../aos-cli/harness_launch_profiles.json), image,
  deployment defaults, and the immutable context-bundle adapter.
* Ward receives the fixed workflow role, selected harness and image, original
  work request, explicit harness environment, broker credential, and optional
  context bundle. In the warded path, a role slug selects composition and grants
  no permissions. Standalone AOS may also use it for launch tuning and its own
  bounded [kubeconfig projection](aos-kubeconfig.md). That standalone gate does
  not transfer a grant into Ward.
* AOSguard owns the independent generated operator surface and its credential
  mounts. Ward neither imports nor configures it.

There are no AOS Ward role guardfiles, KDL defaults, broker grants, topology,
network reach, or release-bundle assets. The former `.ward` concerns moved as
follows:

* Image, release channel, and this repository's landing workflow moved from
  `defaults.kdl` and `repos.kdl` to `.ward/ward.yaml`.
* Models, reasoning effort, verbosity, and local harness defaults moved from
  `agents.kdl` and `roles.kdl` to the embedded AOS launch-profile registry.
  Standalone AOS launches may select its role tuning. Ward-bound launches
  receive only the registry's harness-level defaults through Ward's explicit
  `WARD_*` environment seam, so a Ward workflow role cannot change those
  inputs.
* Role behavior and composed skills remain in `.agents/roles.kdl`.
* Seat names and pronouns remain canonical in agent-compose. AOS does not
  duplicate its person registry.
* Role-derived command grants were retired rather than moved. Ward workflows
  and the separately selected AOSguard surface determine executable authority.
  AOS owns only its bounded standalone runtime inputs, including kubeconfig
  projection.

## Release and validation

AOS releases do not attach a Ward-spec archive. The dev-base image carries the
released `ward`, `aos`, `aoscompose`, `aosward`, and `aosguard` binaries without a
checkout-derived Ward configuration reference. The declared Go and Python
suites cover the always-composed, always-guarded standalone path and the Ward
context-bundle path.
