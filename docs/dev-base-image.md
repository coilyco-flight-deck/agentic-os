# dev-base container image

aos owns the agent dev env. ward consumes it by tag, so config cannot
drift.

This page describes the `dev-base-full` contract. See
[Tiered dev-base image split](dev-base-image-tiering.md).

## What ships

[`docker/dev-base/core/Dockerfile`](../docker/dev-base/core/Dockerfile) layers
the root runtime tier on `ubuntu:24.04`. The sibling tier Dockerfiles live in
[`docker/dev-base/`](../docker/dev-base/) as one folder per tier.

- **core toolchain** - `uv`, pre-commit, Python, shellcheck, git, git-lfs, build-essential, Rust, and ward.
- **language/runtime tiers** - Node, Go, and .NET 10 + ICU.
- **ops / agent CLIs** - aws cli, Homebrew, claude, mcporter, opencode, codex, goose, gh, helm, kubectl, yq, Docker CLI, and the Tailscale client plus `tailscaled`.
- **gate tools** - golangci-lint, trufflehog, and kdlfmt.
- **platform seed** - the substrate mirrors, the baked agent self-name / status-line assets, and the container shell entrypoint that seeds `AOS_REPO_ROOT` plus `WARD_CONFIG_REF` before the read-only director shell starts.

Tools under `/usr/local`, `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew`, or `/opt` run as any uid. ward owns `run-as-uid`, mounts, and `~/.aws`. Root bootstrap seeds `/home/ubuntu/.ward/audit` as uid 1000 and avoids root-owned audit state.

## Naming and tags

Published as one package,
`forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os`, with variants as tags.
`full` is the default tag. The folder name prefixes every other tier, so the
published refs are `agentic-os:${TAG}`, `agentic-os:core-${TAG}`,
`agentic-os:lang-node-${TAG}`, and so on. `promote.yml` first publishes
commit-scoped draft tags, and `release.yml` retags that same image family to
`vX.Y.Z`, `:release`, and `:latest`. The `buildcache` tags hold the cache.

## How it publishes

The publish jobs in [`.forgejo/workflows/promote.yml`](../.forgejo/workflows/promote.yml)
run after the repo gate and before `release` moves. They build one draft per
tier with [`scripts/dev-base-build.py`](../scripts/dev-base-build.py);
`needs:` carries the tier DAG (see the [tiering doc](dev-base-image-tiering.md)).
The same workflow's release jobs retag the draft family to `vX.Y.Z`,
`:release`, and `:latest`, verify manifests, upload the release asset, then
cut the tag before the branch fast-forward. The manual retry workflow in
[`.forgejo/workflows/release.yml`](../.forgejo/workflows/release.yml) keeps the
same logic and never runs on push. The core image stamps `WARD_CONFIG_REF`
from the current commit, so ward launches against the bundled `.ward/`
checkout. The core build runs `ward doctor` first, rejecting a broken bundle
before the draft image publishes.

The shared [`actions/dev-base-build`](../actions/dev-base-build/action.yml)
composite handles the build/verify half. PRs run it build-only, so image
breakage fails before merge. See [PR dev-base build validation](pr-dev-base-build-validation.md).

## Pinning a tool

Versions pin as `ARG`s: hand-edit and push to main to pin or roll back, else a
scheduled **auto-bump** refreshes stale pins ([auto-bump doc](dev-base-auto-bump.md)).
`GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION` and `KDLFMT_VERSION` opt out, bumped by hand.

## Pulling it

```bash
docker pull forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os:release
```

Needs a `docker login`. `ward container up/exec` (ward#98) is the entry point.

## Not here

- Mount / compose logic and `ward container` verbs - ward#98. The mount-eligibility manifest - aos#222.
- `coily` (retired, folded into `ward ops`) and running services - not shipped.
- `docker buildx` and `wasm-pack` - job-local publish or toolchain steps.
- Tailnet daemon startup, auth, and socket wiring - ward owns bring-up.
