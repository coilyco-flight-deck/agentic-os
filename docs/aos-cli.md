doc_goal: Define AOS as the composition root for standalone and Ward-governed agent launches.

# AOS launch CLI

AOS exposes one launch shape with composed context and guarded tools always present:

```bash
aos --agent codex --role engineer -- --version
```

The shared role slug selects context across enabled capabilities and never
transfers authority between tools. Standalone AOS applies bounded access gates such as [kubeconfig projection](aos-kubeconfig.md).

## Launch modes

Every AOS agent launch has these two contexts:

* Agent-compose verifies and projects the selected role into a private staged home.
* AOS attaches standalone `aosguard`, which keeps its specgen credential mounts.

The compatibility flags `--composed` and `--guarded` remain accepted, including
explicit false values, but cannot disable either context.

`aos` and its explicit `aoscompose` alias own one standalone container. The earlier `aoscomposed` spelling remains available as a compatibility alias.
Arguments after `--` become arguments to the selected agent:

```bash
aos --agent codex --role engineer -- --version
aoscompose --agent codex --role engineer -- --version
```

`aosward` is the same executable with warded mode forced. It is equivalent to
`aos --warded`, but `--warded=false` cannot disable its Ward delegation:

```bash
aosward --agent codex --role engineer -- owner/repo#267
```

Warded mode uses Ward's fixed workflows and generic broker for Compose, lifecycle, and [credential handoff](aos-ward-credentials.md).

## Routing

In warded mode, arguments after `--` are Ward launch arguments. AOS passes the
selected image, agent, role, workspace request, optional generic context bundle,
and harness-level model inputs through Ward's explicit environment seam. AOS maps
the resolved profile to Agent Compose's tier, which gates role compatibility only.
Agent-compose carries behavioral identity and seat context. A Ward workflow
cannot change model inputs or privileged surface. See [the context-bundle adapter](aos-context-bundle.md).

Ward ships the `director`, `qa`, and `engineer` repository workflows. Other safe
roles use its [generic read-only command](aos-generic-warded-roles.md). AOS rejects
incompatible agents and translated Ward flags before starting a container.

## Standalone contract

* The moving default image is pulled before each launch. Custom images keep Docker's local behavior.
* CWD mounts read-write at `/workspace/<cwd-name>` and becomes the workdir.
* Composition hydrates the baked provider through `aos-substrate-cache`.
* AOS copies the selected harness's known read-only auth into ephemeral HOME.
* [MCP and tailnet projection](aos-standalone-connectivity.md) preserves the native standalone connectivity baseline.
* [Role-gated kubeconfig projection](aos-kubeconfig.md) mounts one explicit operator-selected source read-only for standalone director and ops launches.
* Present API-key environment variables cross by name, never rendered value.
* Docker socket, AWS config, host HOME, and Git credentials do not mount.

Root performs bootstrap only. The harness runs as the host uid and gid.
Composition verifies the immutable role bundle with `project --scope home`.
`--no-substrate` omits unrelated reference trees.

## Validation and release

`ward exec aos-test` runs Go. The `aos-composition-dry-run`,
`aos-composition-smoke`, and `aos-standalone-composition-smoke` Ward verbs
cover both lifecycle shapes. The [CLI release pipeline](aos-cli-release.md)
publishes checksummed binaries plus Homebrew and Scoop metadata.
