# dev-base build cache

How the dev-base publish jobs stay warm between runs (aos#491). Before this,
a cold multi-arch rebuild of the whole family under qemu routinely hit the
old shared 120-minute timeout, and the flake that cost a release
(agentic-os#490) rode on that coldness.

## The persistent builder is the disk cache

The buildx builder (`aosbuilder`, `docker-container` driver) keeps its layer
cache inside its own container on the runner's long-lived dind sidecar, so
the cache survives between runs exactly as long as the builder does. The old
bootstrap ran `docker buildx rm -f aosbuilder` before every create to dodge a
name collision left by crashed runs - which silently discarded the entire
local cache on every single run.

The [`actions/publish-dev-base-tier`](../actions/publish-dev-base-tier/action.yml)
composite now **reuses** the builder: it creates it only when absent (with a
`|| true` absorbing the create race between sibling tier jobs) and recreates
it only when the existing one genuinely fails to bootstrap. The crash-collision
case still self-heals; the warm cache stops being collateral.

## The registry cache is secondary, and loud when broken

Each tier also reads and writes a `type=registry` cache under its
`<tier>-buildcache` tag, which warms a fresh runner or a recreated builder.
The write keeps `ignore-error=true` - a registry hiccup must not fail an
otherwise-good push - but that made a permanently-cold cache invisible: if the
registry is unhealthy, the cache never populates, every run is cold, and each
cold run pushes even more multi-GB blobs at the struggling registry.

[`scripts/dev-base-build.py`](../scripts/dev-base-build.py) now probes the
buildcache manifest after each pushed tier and emits a `::warning::` in the
job log when the write did not land, so cache rot is observed, not inferred
from slow runs.
