# Agent-compose AOS capability provider

AOS publishes reusable ordinary and role-composed skills for agent-compose.
The provider is local and deterministic. A consumer reads the checkout
directly and fetches no context over the network.

## Ownership boundary

* **AOS** - owns ordinary skills, role-scoped skills, role bindings, and the public agent and harness capability registry.
* **agent-compose** - owns roles, personality compatibility, seats, identity, colors, the personality invariant and definitions, selection, and materialization.
* **Ward** - owns executable authority, permissions, credentials, and runtime risk controls.

Shared role and skill names join the first two layers without moving authority
into knowledge content.

## Provider contract

Agent-compose infers every ordinary skill from `.agents/skills/`. Every role
receives those skills. It separately reads `.agents/roles.kdl` and selects
only the current role's sources from `.agents/composed/`.

Composed sources use `COMPOSED.md`, never `SKILL.md`. Agent-compose renames the
selected entrypoint to `SKILL.md` while building the role's isolated bundle.
Unselected role sources leave no catalog metadata or trace in that bundle.
See [role-composed skills](role-composed-skills.md) for the complete contract.

The compose request supplies the stable source id `aos-public`, so adding an
ordinary skill or role binding needs no parallel provider inventory.

The provider also publishes `.agents/harnesses.yaml` as the canonical
model-opaque registry of agent and harness identity, source links, and
compatible intents. AOSH consumes a generated mirror for offline scoring while
retaining role joins, lane selections, models, and backend routes.

Agent-compose activates the complete ordered personality meld for a selected
role. A request cannot select an arbitrary trait or change compatibility.
Agent-compose embeds the invariant and all 16 canonical definition trees under
its `person:kai` source. AOS commits a narrow alignment board that verifies the
ordered meld and skill ids in measured bundles without selecting runtime
behavior. See
[role-orientation projections](role-orientation-projections.md).

## Local consumer use

An agent-compose request stored under the provider root admits that root:

```kdl
compose {
    role "engineer"
    delivery "native-skills"
    source "aos-public" root="." required=#true
}
```

`compiled` delivery joins selected `SKILL.md` bodies into one document. Native
delivery preserves selected skill directories. Both modes carry the embedded
invariant and personality definitions without an AOS personality provider.

Host convergence needs no `roster_sources` entry for personalities. Optional
roster sources remain overlay inputs. Container composition admits the AOS
root for capabilities and uses the embedded person source for personalities.

## Behavioral boundary

Personality affects attention, framing, tempo, voice, and tie-breaking among
valid actions. Personality does not change truthfulness, uncertainty
reporting, obligations, acceptance criteria, permissions, safety,
escalation, rollback, or completion. A silent successful run needs no
personality theater.
