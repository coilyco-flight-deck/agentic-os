# Role surface tiers

The intended capability surface each `ward agent` container role carries, made
deliberate after the 2026-07-10 permissions rollback stripped the director and
advisor surfaces below operational need (agentic-os#447). This is the reviewed
definition. A live surface that differs from it is drift to fix.

## Tiers

* **engineer** - forgejo read + actions read + write - lands code inside its clone, no live infra reach.
* **qa** - forgejo read + actions read + write - inspects a candidate and posts a verdict comment.
* **advisor** - forgejo read + actions read + aws/ssm + tailnet live-observe - answers with live findings, never writes code. The live-observe pair (tailnet + `~/.aws`) is the documented default this role lost in the rollback.
* **director** - forgejo read + actions read + write + aws/ssm + kubectl + runner-token mint + tailnet live-observe - drives the headless lane and fronts incident recovery.
* **ops** - forgejo read + actions read + write + aws/ssm + kubectl + runner-token mint + tailnet live-observe - live system maintenance, the widest tier.

Runner-token mint is `ward ops forgejo actions generate-runner-token`
([guardfile](../.ward/guardfile.forgejo.runnertoken.kdl)), whose absence
blocked the infrastructure#539 token restore. It stays out of the fleet-wide
[readactions overlay](../.ward/guardfile.forgejo.readactions.kdl): minting a
credential is director/ops reach, not a read.

## Layer ownership

Each capability is owned by exactly one layer, so a one-layer rollback reads
as drift against this map instead of silently disabling a role.

* **guardfile bindings** - [.ward/roles.kdl](../.ward/roles.kdl), authored here - which guarded verb families a role mounts: the forgejo read/readactions/write tiers, [aws](../.ward/guardfile.aws.kdl), [tailscale](../.ward/guardfile.tailscale.kdl), [kubectl](../.ward/guardfile.kubectl.kdl), [runner-token](../.ward/guardfile.forgejo.runnertoken.kdl). Per ward#578 the tailnet and `~/.aws` reach of a role container keys off these bindings.
* **role presets** - ward's tree - tagline, capabilities, modes, posture. Stripped from the aos overlay on 2026-07-10 (commit 566f42f) by design, never re-authored here.
* **image binaries** - [docker/dev-base/](dev-base-image-tiering.md), authored here - whether `aws`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `tailscale`, `tailscaled`, and the Docker client exist on disk. They land in the `ops` image tier and flow into `agent` and `full`.
* **container bring-up** - ward's tree - whether creds and daemons are live: the `~/.aws` dir, a kubeconfig, `tailscaled` process/auth/socket wiring, `FORGEJO_TOKEN`, and the `WARD_CONTEXT_LEVEL` context slice. A binary existing says nothing about this layer.

The 2026-07-10 incident: guardfiles still compiled in, but the binaries,
creds, and daemons under them were gone, and nothing flagged it.

## Live-check ownership

The capability map above is descriptive. If a live probe of the role surface is
still desired, that check belongs in ward's bring-up path, where ward owns the
container state and can make the result authoritative. See ward#1072 for the
ward-owned follow-up path.

## Deferred

Merge authority and commit-status read stay out of this map on purpose: the
ward-native PR workflow capability is foundational ward-side work, and the
specgen also-grant convenience is agentic-os#446.
