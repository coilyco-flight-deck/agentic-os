# CI parity: run app CI inside the pinned dev-base

Every app's CI runs **inside the pinned [dev-base image](dev-base-image.md),
through the same `ward exec` verbs the agents run**, so a green CI means "a
headless agent can actually land this," not "it passed in some other
environment" (agentic-os#328).

The current contract still pins one `dev-base-full` image per app. The tiered
split keeps that default but introduces narrower classes behind the same
release tag. See [Tiered dev-base image split](dev-base-image-tiering.md).

## The motivating failure

On an app, CI was green while **every** dispatched `warded` run died. The two
environments had diverged: CI ran a bare runner + `setup-uv` (which fetches its
own writable Python, green), while the agent ran in dev-base where a root-owned
`UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR` blocked `uv run` (red, invisibly). CI was validating a
world no agent lives in. Pinning CI to the same image the agents use makes those
environment regressions fail **loudly, on a PR**, before any container dispatches.

## The convention

Each app CI job runs in the dev-base container and invokes the app's own gate
verbs instead of hand-rolled `uv run` steps:

- `container: forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os:<pinned-tag>`
- `ward exec test` / `ward exec lint` / `ward exec smoke` - the same verbs a
  dispatched agent runs. Each app defines these in its own `.ward/ward.yaml`.

[`ci-in-dev-base-example.yml`](ci-in-dev-base-example.yml) is a copy-paste
starting point for an app's `.forgejo/workflows/*.yml`.

This repo's live companion is [`.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml`](../.forgejo/workflows/ci.yml).
It keeps the workflow name `ci` and the job name `gate`, so Forgejo branch
protection can require the `ci / gate` status context on `pull-request-and-merge`
repos. The live gate runs `pytest` plus `pre-commit run --all-files`, matching
the release gate so a PR cannot pass what main would refuse.

## Pinned, not the moving alias

CI pins an explicit `vX.Y.Z` tag, never the moving `:release` alias, so a run is
reproducible and adopting a newer dev-base is a **deliberate** bump - which
itself re-validates every app on the next rollout - not silent drift.

## The pinned-tag source of truth

<!-- freshness: as-of=2026-07-05 decay-class=pointer half-life=slow -->
The pin now derives from the tier folder layout through
[`scripts/dev-base-build.py`](../scripts/dev-base-build.py). That helper turns
`docker/dev-base/<tier>/Dockerfile` plus the release tag into the literal
`agentic-os:<tier>-<tag>` ref (`agentic-os:<tag>` for `full`, the default
surface), so there is no checked-in JSON map of identical refs to drift.
[dev-base-image.md](dev-base-image.md) covers how those tags publish.

## Authoring vs rollout

aos **authors** the convention and the pinned tag. It does not reach into other
repos. An ansible/template rollout in `infrastructure` **reads** the tag file
and templates it into each app's workflow as a literal `container:` tag, per the
authoring-vs-rollout law. An app CI never fetches the tag downward at run time -
it carries a rendered literal, bumped only when the rollout re-runs.

## Rollout unit

Each app's `.forgejo/workflows/*.yml` is the rollout unit; the first mover /
reference adopter is a single app, on its own adoption issue. The blocking
dependency was the dev-base image fix (agentic-os#327): with the image fixed,
ward verbs pass inside dev-base and parity holds green.
