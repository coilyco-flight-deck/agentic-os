# Role-intent harness selection

AOS publishes a model-opaque default harness for every supported role-intent
lane. Harness selection answers which work surface receives a task. Backend
model, server, score, fallback, and hardware selection remain separate concerns.

## Confirmed board

The committed board contains ten roles and sixteen lanes:

* **engineer** - `autonomous-coding` uses `openhands`.
* **director** - `strategic-planning` uses `plandex`.
* **qa** - `code-review` uses `aider`.
* **advisor** - `research-synthesis` uses `hermes`.
* **ops** - `ops-investigation` uses `holmesgpt`. `operational-decision` uses
  `goose`.
* **pm** - `strategic-planning` uses `hermes`. `project-coordination` uses
  `plane`.
* **designer** - `product-shaping` uses `penpot`. `design-production` uses
  `aosx`.
* **social** - `message-composition` uses `mixpost`. `channel-publishing` uses
  `elizaos`.
* **sales** - `research-synthesis` uses `hermes`. `conversation-management` uses
  `elizaos`.
* **customer-success** - `knowledge-retrieval` and `conversation-management`
  both use `rasa`.

Engineer is the sole unattended lane. Every role declares one or two intents,
and every lane has exactly one selected harness.

## Resolve a default

The released `aos` binary embeds the committed projection. Its resolver accepts
role identity at the control-plane boundary and emits only the selected harness
slug:

```bash
aos --role director harness-default --intent strategic-planning
```

The command prints `plandex`. A harness receives the selected intent through its
own adapter, never the role used to choose it.

Some selections are terminal agent harnesses. Others are product surfaces such
as Penpot, Plane, Mixpost, or Rasa. The resolver therefore does not auto-execute
its result. A launcher or Ward profile consumes the slug and invokes the
surface-specific adapter. `aos acompose` continues to require an explicit
container command:

```bash
aos --role engineer acompose -- codex
```

## Ownership and synchronization

AOSH owns the hand-selected `roles.yaml`, `agent-selections.yaml`, and `harnesses.yaml`.
AOS owns the generated `role-harnesses` block in [`.ward/roles.kdl`](../.ward/roles.kdl),
the committed human-visible Ward-profile projection.

The sync also writes [`role-harnesses.json`](../aos/role-harnesses.json) as the
compiled view embedded by the standalone `aos` binary. The JSON does not become
a second hand-owned source. The drift check requires both generated views to
match the same AOSH board.

Run `ward exec sync-harness-board` after an AOSH selection changes. Run
`ward exec sync-harness-board -- --check` for a read-only drift check. Local
pre-commit performs the same check when the sibling AOSH checkout exists.
Public checkouts without that sibling report a visible skip.

Malformed or incomplete present sources fail closed. The generated KDL region
is marker-bounded so the sync preserves hand-owned guardfiles, agent overlays,
and role shells in the rest of `roles.kdl`. Both views copy only role, intent,
and harness identity plus schema counts and role-source provenance. Neither
copies backend routing data.
