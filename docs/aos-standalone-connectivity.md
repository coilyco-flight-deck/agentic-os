doc_goal: Define MCP inventory and tailnet projection for standalone AOS launches.

# AOS standalone connectivity

AOS preserves the operator's MCP connectivity baseline when AOS owns the
container. This bootstrap behavior applies without `--warded` and does not
change the selected role's authority.

## MCP inventory

AOS discovers the resolved host `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` when that file is
present. The launcher mounts only that inventory read-only. It does not mount
host HOME, OAuth caches, or unrelated harness configuration.

Container bootstrap uses the AOS projector after projecting harness defaults.
Claude and Codex receive native MCP registrations. Every harness receives the
mcporter inventory as an on-demand CLI fallback. The same projector backs
[native environment convergence](aos-convergence.md), so staged and host
registries share one validation and rendering contract.

## Tailnet HTTP endpoints

AOS joins the shared `ward-tailnet` Docker network whenever that network
exists. It exports `AOS_TAILNET_SOCKS5=socks5h://tailscale-proxy:1055` for
tools that explicitly support SOCKS without setting a global proxy.

AOS also resolves each HTTP MCP hostname on the host. When an address is
inside a Tailscale range, AOS:

* rewrites that endpoint in the ephemeral inventory to a private loopback port
* starts an unprivileged TCP bridge for the endpoint
* sends bridge traffic through `tailscale-proxy:1055`

The bridge sends the resolved tailnet address to the SOCKS proxy, so it does
not depend on proxy-side MagicDNS. Public MCP endpoints keep their original
URLs and do not use the bridge.

Tailnet MCP bridging currently supports `http` URLs. AOS rejects a detected
tailnet `https` endpoint instead of silently breaking TLS hostname validation.

## Host network

`aoscompose` and `aoscomposed` launch with Docker host networking. Private tools
should bind `127.0.0.1:<port>`, which opens at that URL from the host browser.
This mode replaces `ward-tailnet` for these aliases. Bare `aos --role ...` and
`aosward` keep network ownership.

## Outage behavior

MCP registration remains visible when the standing proxy is cycling. Calls to
tailnet-only endpoints fail until infrastructure restores the proxy. A running
standalone agent can use the bridge after the proxy returns because each bridge
dials the proxy for every new connection.

The infrastructure tailscale-proxy role owns proxy convergence. AOS neither
starts nor repairs that service.

## Kubeconfig coexistence

An authorized standalone launch can add the
[operator-selected kubeconfig mount](aos-kubeconfig.md) while retaining the
same MCP inventory, `ward-tailnet` attachment, SOCKS environment, and endpoint
forwarders. Kubeconfig projection does not infer cluster transport from the
credential document.

## Security and authority

The host inventory is operator configuration, not role policy. Projection adds
tool discovery and network reach only. `--role` still selects context,
`--composed` still selects agent-compose projection, and Ward remains the only
owner of Ward runtime policy when `--warded` is present.
