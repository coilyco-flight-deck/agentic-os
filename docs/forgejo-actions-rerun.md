# Forgejo Actions rerun bridge

The `.ward/forgejo-actions-rerun.sh` and
`.ward/forgejo-actions-rerun-failed-jobs.sh` bridges re-run an existing Forgejo
Actions workflow run by visible run id. They stay narrow on purpose. The call
targets a known run, then falls back to dispatching that run's workflow file
for the same ref when Forgejo does not expose a usable rerun control.

The companion specverb fetch overlay in
[`.ward/guardfile.forgejo.kdl`](../.ward/guardfile.forgejo.kdl) pins the dead
Forgejo API rerun routes from agentic-os#473. PR #529 replaced those routes
with the live web UI helper below, and this fetch mirror keeps the dead shape
documented instead of hand-coding another raw HTTP call.

Why the bridge exists:

- Forgejo exposes the rerun controls inconsistently on this deployment, so the
  bridge keeps the bot token in the ward bundle and the run id as the authority
  boundary, then dispatches the workflow file when rerun controls are absent.
- `actions rerun` tries the run page's `/rerun` control first, then falls back
  to workflow dispatch for the same ref.
- `actions rerun-failed-jobs` tries the failed-job rerun controls when
  available, then falls back to workflow dispatch for the same ref.

The resolved routes are:

- `POST /{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/rerun`
- `POST /{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs/{job_index}/rerun`
- `POST /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflowfilename}/dispatches`
