# AOSH projections into AOS

Agent-compose owns behavioral roles, seats, and identity. AOS owns semantic
role-intent-harness routing and the concrete deployment tuning that its
launchers apply. AOSH owns model measurements and generic model-selection
evidence. Shipped AOS runtimes embed their projections and never fetch an
authoring repository at launch.

## Role-intent harness board

AOS's hand-owned [`.agents/harnesses.yaml`](../.agents/harnesses.yaml) defines
public harness identity and intent compatibility. AOS's hand-owned
[`.agents/role-harnesses.yaml`](../.agents/role-harnesses.yaml) defines the
model-opaque role joins and lane choices. `ward exec sync-harness-board`
validates the joined inputs,
updates generated `intent` children inside the agent-compose provider roles in
[`.agents/roles.kdl`](../.agents/roles.kdl), and rewrites
[`role-harnesses.json`](../aos/role-harnesses.json) as the compiled launcher
view.

The board projection has role, intent, harness, and route data only. Models,
endpoints, reasoning, hardware, permission, and routing rationale do not cross
that projection boundary.

The released `aos` binary embeds the compiled view. `aos --role ROLE
lane-default --intent INTENT` emits the selected harness and stable route
without backend identity. Run `ward exec sync-harness-board -- --check` for a
read-only drift check.

## Concrete launch profiles

[`harness_launch_profiles.json`](../aos/harness_launch_profiles.json) is the
AOS-owned deployment source for model, reasoning-effort, verbosity, and local
endpoint values. Its role overrides preserve the launch tuning formerly stored
under `.ward`, while its defaults preserve harness-wide values.

For a Ward launch, `aos` resolves only the harness default and passes it through
Ward's explicit `WARD_*` environment seam. Director, engineer, and QA therefore
receive identical inputs for the same harness, including workflows without
local config flags. Standalone Codex bootstrap may apply the registry's
role-specific tuning without projecting that choice into Ward. Ward does not
load the registry and no profile grants authority.

## Personality alignment

`ward exec sync-role-personalities` reads agent-compose's emitted person
snapshot and writes [`role-personalities.json`](../aos/role-personalities.json)
for context-budget verification. Agent-compose remains the runtime owner of
personalities and named seats.
