# The native agent terminal

Two things decide what a native agent session looks like: `aterm`, which opens
the window, and the status-line composer, which fills the rows inside it.

## `aterm`

`aterm` opens one composed agent session in its own branded Alacritty window. It
is the windowed sibling of the `acompose` shell function and runs the same
runtime, a leased native session shadow wrapping `agent-compose launch`.
`acompose` takes over the terminal you typed in, `aterm` leaves it free.

```text
aterm                              # pick a role, then a seat
aterm platform                     # the role's default seat
aterm platform codex               # an explicit seat
aterm platform codex -- --resume   # arguments for the harness
aterm --list                       # the live roster, no window
aterm --dry-run platform           # the resolved plan, no window
```

It needs `agent-compose` and Alacritty on `PATH` and bundles neither. `aos`
supplies the session shadow, and without it `aterm` still launches, just without
a leased workspace. `aterm --version` reports the same
`aos-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release every other AOS binary does.

**It refuses a stale role before it opens anything.** Role slugs turn over, so
`aterm` reads `agent-compose catalog roles --json` on every run, validates
against it, and names the live roster in the refusal. A transposed `platform`
comes back as `is not a live role. Did you mean platform?` followed by every
live slug and its display name. A seat is checked twice: it has to belong to the
role, and it has to be a harness
`agent-compose launch` can start. A catalogue seat like `penpot` is real but not
launchable, and the refusal says which of the two it failed.

**A failing launch stays on screen.** Alacritty closes the window the moment its
child exits, so a launch that failed used to vanish before anyone could read
why. `aterm` runs the child through its own `_session` stage instead of handing
it straight to `alacritty -e`. That stage passes the exit code through and holds
the window on any non-zero exit, and `--hold` also holds after a clean exit. The
launcher watches the terminal for a startup failure rather than detaching blind,
so "no window appeared" comes back as a message naming the cause.

## Status-line composer

A provider-discovery framework that auto-mounts the **full segment-composed
status line** into every warded container, so an in-container agent session
shows the same line a host session does.

## The problem it replaces

The retired host `agent-name.sh` hand-wired the
second row: it ran `$project_dir/.agentic-os/statusline.sh` and
`$AGENT_STATUSLINE_EXTRA` and appended their output. The container copy did not,
and `statusline.sh` was never shipped into the [dev-base image](dev-base-image.md),
so everything past the name row was absent in containers. Adding each segment by
hand does not scale and forces external users to fork the composer to customize.

## How it works

A **composer** ([`docker/dev-base/statusline.sh`](../docker/dev-base/statusline.sh))
is Claude Code's `statusLine` command. It reads the `statusLine` JSON payload on
stdin, runs each discovered **provider** in filename order (handing it the same
payload on stdin), and joins their output into the multi-row line.

**Provider contract:** exit 0 with stdout = that segment; empty stdout or a
non-zero exit = skipped. So a segment **self-suppresses** when irrelevant - the
Agent Compose provider renders nothing outside a projected workspace, or where
`acompose` is absent.

The built-in provider is:

* `15-agent-compose.sh` - asks `acompose statusline` to render the immutable
  bundle identity, role and harness, selected catalog footprint, and
  composition health.

* `20-container.sh` - names the warded container from `WARD_CONTAINER_NAME`,
  since inside a container the hostname is an opaque id. Silent on a host.

Two earlier base providers were removed. `10-agent-name.sh` rendered the
pre-acompose `<harness>-<os>-<host>-<tag>-<pronouns>` self-name row, which
duplicated the identity `acompose statusline` already renders. `20-repos.sh`
rendered a stray-checkout count, which is residency scanning rather than
session state. `agent-name.sh` itself is now retired: the
[SessionStart banner](dev-base-agent-identity.md) reads `acompose whoami`.

Agent Compose owns the row's content and bundle semantics. AOS only
discovers the provider and passes the project directory, so the status line
does not grow a second projection parser or identity cache.

## Discovery and overlays

The composer walks three provider dirs, lowest precedence first:

1. **base** - `<composer-dir>/statusline.d` (baked into the image; override with `AOS_STATUSLINE_DIR`).
2. **user** - `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/agentic-os/statusline.d`.
3. **repo** - `<project_dir>/.agentic-os/statusline.d`.

A same-named file in a higher dir **overrides** the lower one; a new `NN-*.sh`
**adds** a row. A shadowing file that is not executable **masks** the lower
provider. So a project or an external user customizes the line by dropping in a
provider - **no fork** of the composer. Use 2-digit prefixes (lexical sort puts
`100` before `20`).

## Why it auto-mounts everywhere

Every warded container runs dev-base, and the baked policy-tier
[`managed-settings.json`](dev-base-agent-identity.md) points `statusLine` at the
composer. ward injects no `statusLine` of its own, so the baked one is
authoritative. A new base provider rides the next image build to **all**
containers at once, with no per-container edit. On hosts,
`install-session-name.py` conservatively migrates its legacy direct self-name
command to this composer, and repoints a SessionStart hook still wired to the
retired `agent-name.sh`. The infrastructure claude-hooks role invokes that
installer, keeping rollout separate from the provider authored here.
