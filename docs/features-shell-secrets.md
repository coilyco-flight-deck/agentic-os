# Features: shell and secret handling

Cross-platform shell, terminal, and secret-handling capabilities.

## Cross-platform shell

One shared config core (`shell/common.sh`) sourced by both shells, so bash and zsh run identical setup. zsh (`shell/zshrc`) and bash (`shell/bashrc`) are thin entries that source the core and add only their own prompt + completion. Boots cleanly on Mac, Linux (kai-server), and Windows (Git Bash), picking the right per-OS PATH via `uname -s`. Carries identity, history, AWS defaults, commit-addressed `WARD_CONFIG_REF`, `WARD_LOCKDOWN_ROOT`, git helpers, aliases, an `rg` wrapper, and the SSM loader.

The core's env + PATH block runs once per terminal tree, gated by an exported `_SIREN_SHELL_ENV` guard: a nested shell inherits the env and skips re-running brew/pyenv/PATH, while still defining aliases and functions (per-shell, never inherited). Env + PATH load for non-interactive shells too (scripts, ssh exec, the Claude Code Bash tool). Prompt and completion are interactive-only. Both shells auto-cd from `$HOME` to an existing `$WARP_STARTUP_DIR`, or `~/projects` when unset. The same operator-local override drives Warp's new-tab directory. Host-specific lines live in untracked `~/.shellrc.local` (shared) or `~/.{bash,zsh}rc.local` (per shell).

## Agent-CLI repo gate

`claude`, `codex`, and `opencode` are wrapped in shell functions that refuse to launch outside a git work tree. The gate lives in the shell - outside the agent - because a harness boundary can only be widened from outside the agent, never by the agent rewriting its own rules, and the shell is the one chokepoint shared across harnesses, so a single `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` check covers them uniformly. Override deliberately with `AOS_ALLOW_ANY=1` for the intentional elevated-cwd cases (a session above the org dirs, or non-repo automation). Fresh shells land at the workspace root by default. Pointing `WARP_STARTUP_DIR` at a checkout lets an agent CLI launch without a separate `cd`.

`ward-kdl agents <cli>` (the cli-guard launchers) execs the real binary directly, so a sibling `ward-kdl` shell function re-applies the gate before it runs - in the shell, not baked into ward. `agents ui` and `ops` are not launches and stay ungated.

## In-process AWS SSM secret loader

Pull secrets directly into the shell environment, never to disk. `ssm-load` reads every SecureString under the configured prefix and `load-env`s them. `ssm-get <name>` fetches a single value to stdout, a memory-only path.

## Cross-platform terminal

Alacritty supplies the portable Sombra rendering baseline. Zellij supplies the
long-lived workspace, vertical tabs, panes, and session serialization. The
[workspace walkthrough](zellij-workspace.md) carries the recovery behavior and
daily controls.

The transitional Warp config tree still renders into `~/.warp-preview/` on the
Mac daily driver (Preview channel, with Stable at `~/.warp/` selectable through
`--channel`) and `~/.warp/` on Windows. The repo wins over cloud sync
(`is_settings_sync_enabled = false`) so theme, font, vertical tabs, AI and agent
toggles, and the secret-redaction regex list stay reproducible across hosts.
The redaction surface covers IPv4 and IPv6, MAC, AWS keys, GitHub tokens,
Stripe, Firebase, JWT, OpenAI, Anthropic, Fireworks, Google keys, Slack tokens,
and phone numbers.

## GPG signing without disk-cached passphrases

`gpg-ssm` is a wrapper around `gpg` that pulls the signing passphrase from AWS SSM at sign time instead of caching it on disk. When the configured signing key is missing locally, it bootstraps `/coilysiren/gpg-secret-key` in memory before signing. Mac/Linux + Windows (`.cmd` shim for Git for Windows). Wire it in once with `git config --global gpg.program`.

## Install surface

[README.md](../README.md) carries per-OS install steps. `ward exec apply-shell-links` repairs shell links, `gpg-ssm`, and the Forgejo git credential helper. Windows skips `~/.bashrc` so Git Bash hook launchers cannot recreate stale state. Mac/Linux can also use plain `ln -sf`. Windows symlinks need Developer Mode or elevation.
