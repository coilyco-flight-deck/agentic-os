"""leak-guard ruleset: terms held as hex, decoded only in memory by the check.

Each rule bans a term in a scope. The term is lowercase hex (see
`leak-guard-encode`) so a plain `rg <term>` over this file finds nothing - the
ruleset honors the guard it drives. Add a sensitive term without it touching
shell history:

    leak-guard-encode            # type or pipe the term, copy the hex

Rule fields:
    id            - stable slug, shown in violations and used to opt out.
    term_hex      - the banned term, lowercase hex (never plaintext).
    repos         - list of repo slugs (origin basename) the rule fires in;
                    omit or None to fire everywhere.
    allow_globs   - repo-relative path globs where the term is permitted.
    only_globs    - if set, the rule fires *only* in these paths (the dual of
                    allow_globs; e.g. enforce on the front-page README alone).
    word_boundary - match on \\b...\\b (default True; `ward` skips `forward`).
    case_sensitive- default False.
    message       - remediation, printed on a hit. Never name the term here.

The rules below cover the three leak/coupling classes (sensitive data,
private->public reference, dependency cycle); the dependency-cycle class carries
more than one edge. See coilysiren/inbox#95 and docs/leak-guard.md.
