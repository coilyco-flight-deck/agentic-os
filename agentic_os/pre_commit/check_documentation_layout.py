"""Enforce repo documentation placement and size.

This module is the single source of truth for Markdown size caps across the
agentic-os ecosystem. Docs (AGENTS.md, SKILL.md.template, handbook.md, etc.)
should point here by reference rather than restating numbers, so the caps
can never drift between code and prose.

Markdown documentation may live only in:
    1. the repo root, with a small universal filename allow-list;
    2. docs/*.md, with no docs subdirectories;
    3. skill folders (.agents/skills, .agents/composed, .claude/skills, or
       skills), which may carry support subdirs. No nested skill entry point
       may hide below the top-level skill dir;
    4. anywhere under an `examples/` directory at any depth, any .md filename;
    5. a co-located module README.md, but only in one of two tightly-capped
       shapes (see below). Any other co-located Markdown is still a violation.

Module README.md shapes
-----------------------
A README.md anywhere below the root (outside docs/, skill, examples) is the
one co-located doc the layout permits, because deep docs are invisible to
anyone not running `rg`. To keep substance in the central, browsable docs/
index rather than scattered through the tree, the co-located README may only
be one of two tightly-capped shapes - the cap is the forcing function, since
nothing worth hiding fits in 3 lines:

    * outpost  - a pure redirect into docs/. <= 3 non-blank lines: a heading,
      an optional one-sentence summary, and exactly one link to a single
      docs/*.md file. Reciprocal: that docs file must link back to this exact
      README path (file-to-file). One docs file may be the target of many
      outposts (each gets its own back-link); one outpost points at one doc.
    * homestead - self-contained signage that points nowhere. <= 3 non-blank
      lines (heading + up to 2 content lines), no docs/ pointer.

Both cap prose lines at README_MAX_PROSE_CHARS. The pointer line of an
outpost is exempt from that cap - a deep relative path is not prose. Blank
lines never count toward the line ceiling. The discriminator is simple: a
README that links a docs/*.md file is an outpost, otherwise it is a
homestead.

Most Markdown shares one size cap: MAX_MARKDOWN_LINES / MAX_MARKDOWN_CHARS.
SKILL.md and COMPOSED.md are not special. CLAUDE.md is expected to be a
one-line `@AGENTS.md` pointer.

The root README.md and AGENTS.md carry each project's living overview (intro
and operating doctrine), so both get more room than ordinary Markdown.
README.md uses TRIFECTA_MAX_LINES / TRIFECTA_MAX_CHARS. AGENTS.md gets a larger
default because universal person and operating context must fire eagerly while
selective capability detail moves into ordinary and composed skills.
docs/FEATURES.md is a coarse inventory of major shipped capabilities, so it
gets the tighter FEATURES_MAX_LINES / FEATURES_MAX_CHARS cap. Bounded, not
infinite: durable detail still belongs in docs/*.md. README.md only at repo
root; a co-located module README stays on the tight outpost / homestead shape.

AGENTS.md sets its own cap, per-repo, via config keys `agents_md_max_lines` /
`agents_md_max_chars` under the documentation-layout hook section. The declared
value replaces the default outright, in either direction: a loader-bound
AGENTS.md holding universal-fire doctrine that can't split into docs/*.md may
buy headroom, and a repo whose role-scoped doctrine has already moved out to
the sources that own it may set a tighter cap as deliberate back-pressure.
Repos that don't set them get the shared AGENTS.md default.

The root README.md gets the same per-repo override, via `readme_max_lines` /
`readme_max_chars`. It is the launch-grade front page a cold visitor (human or
agent) reads to decide in under a minute whether the tool is for them, so a
release repo may need room to say who it's for and what it requires, show a
denial, and route into docs/ - more than the trifecta default gives. Repos
that don't set the keys keep the trifecta cap. Only the root README.md opts up;
a co-located module README stays on the tight outpost / homestead shape.
