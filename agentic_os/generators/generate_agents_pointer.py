"""Generate and check the managed workspace-pointer block in a repo's AGENTS.md.

Every per-repo `AGENTS.md` opens with a one-line pointer at the workspace base.
Hand-written, it drifted into three styles and several dangled: `See ../AGENTS.md`
resolves to a non-existent `coilyco-bridge/AGENTS.md`, because the repos live in
different org dirs and are not checked out in a guaranteed sibling layout. The
canonical content already loads globally via `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, so the
pointer's real job is to orient a reader WITHOUT that load point (a foreign
agent, a single-repo clone, CI) - for whom only an absolute URL is true.

This module is the single source of truth for that pointer, rendered as a
marker-delimited managed block. It mirrors `generate_repo_pointer_skill`: a pure,
deterministic renderer plus a `check_drift` the validator (`check_agents_pointer`)
uses to regenerate offline and fail on any drift. The applier
(`scripts/apply-agents-pointer.py`) injects or refreshes the block in place.

Each org points at its own base, on the host appropriate to its trust tier:
  - coilyco-flight-deck/* -> the public base on GitHub (the public face).
  - coilyco-bridge/*      -> the public base on GitHub with the private
    agentic-os-kai overlay (Forgejo) layered on top, expressing that aos-pub is
    the foundation and aos-kai layers Kai-specific context over it.
The canonical base repos themselves (agentic-os, agentic-os-kai) are exempt:
a base does not point at itself. coilysiren/* stays deliberately unmanaged: it
is Kai's public personal org, outside the coilyco-* fleet, and its handful of
repos are `.agentic-os-ignore`-exempt and hand-authored (the profile repo
coilysiren/coilysiren carries a bespoke bootstrap, not a one-line pointer). So
those repos are hand-maintained per-repo rather than templated - extending
generator management over a public org would fire the drift hook across it for
    little gain.

Schema and rollout: see docs/features-agents-pointer.md.
