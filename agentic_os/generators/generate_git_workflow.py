"""Generate and check the managed git-workflow block in a repo's AGENTS.md.

Every repo's landing lane is declared once, as `ward.workflow` in the AGENTS.md
frontmatter, and was then restated by hand in a one-line `**Git workflow** -`
stamp under `## Agent rules`. Hand-stamped, it said what the lane was without
ever saying that the lane is a standing authorization, so an agent reading it
still treated a commit, a branch, a push, or a pull request as an action worth
stopping to ask about. A turn that stops there ends with the work stranded in a
dirty worktree, which is the loss vector agentic-os#1150 records.

This module is the single source of truth for that stamp, rendered as a
marker-delimited managed block. It mirrors `generate_agents_pointer`: a pure,
deterministic renderer plus a `check_drift` the validator (`check_git_workflow`)
uses to regenerate offline and fail on any drift. The applier
(`scripts/apply-git-workflow.py`) injects or refreshes the block in place.

The block details both lanes the fleet actually runs (`merge-remote-main` and
`pull-request-and-merge`), names which one this repo is on, and states the
pre-authorization in MUST / ALWAYS / NEVER terms. Both lanes authorize the same
core actions, so an agent that has read the block never needs to ask whether
committing or pushing is allowed here. The two genuine walls, `--no-verify` and
force-push, stay closed in the same breath, so the block reads as a boundary
rather than a blanket.

Every slug names what the AGENT does, and the block says so outright because
the first two drafts of this generator got it backwards. `pull-request-and-merge`
carries the merge because the agent that authored the code merges its own pull
request, which makes it the fully autonomous lane rather than the gated one.
`pull-request` drops `-and-merge` because the author stops at the pull request
and the director merge lane takes over. Ward's `agent_director_merge` currently
gates director merges on the opposite slug, so its behavior contradicts this
until someone reconciles it.

Every repo with a root AGENTS.md gets the block, org-agnostic and with no base
repo exempt. A lane binds the agent in the canonical base exactly as it binds
one in a consumer, unlike the workspace pointer, which a base does not owe
itself. A repo that declares no lane renders the `pull-request` variant, the
one lane that neither pushes `main` nor merges, rather than guessing at an
authority the repo never granted.

`--print-lane` exists because `scripts/pr-guard-pre-push.sh` is bash and
needs the same answer this module already owns, rather than a second
frontmatter parser of its own (agentic-os#1321).

_BODY = f"""The fleet runs two lanes, and both authorize the same core actions:

* `{MERGE_MAIN}` - the agent commits, pushes to `main`, and closes the issue. No branch and no pull request.
* `{PR_AND_MERGE}` - the agent commits to a task branch, pushes it, opens a pull request, and merges that pull request itself once it is green.

**Every lane slug names what the AGENT does, never what someone else does.** `{PR_AND_MERGE}` carries the merge because the agent that authored the code merges its own pull request. `{PULL_REQUEST}` drops `-and-merge` because the author stops at the pull request and the director merge lane takes over. Reading `{PR_AND_MERGE}` as "someone else merges it later" inverts the two lanes and leaves finished work sitting unmerged.

**These actions are pre-authorized on every lane, and the agent MUST take them without asking first.** Committing, creating a branch, pushing a branch, pushing the lane's own destination, and opening a pull request are ordinary reversible work, not the destructive wall that earns a question. Stopping to ask is how a turn ends with the work stranded in a dirty worktree.

* **ALWAYS commit** in-scope work and **ALWAYS push** it to the canonical remote before pausing, reporting a checkpoint, handing off, or ending a turn. A local-only commit is not a checkpoint.
* **ALWAYS open the pull request** in the same turn as the branch's first push, on every lane except `{BRANCH_ONLY}`. A pushed branch with no pull request is litter nobody reviews.
* **NEVER `--no-verify`** and **NEVER force-push**. Those two are the real walls, and they stay closed.
* **ALWAYS merge your own pull request on `{PR_AND_MERGE}`**, in the same turn, as soon as it is green. Reporting it as open and awaiting someone is the failure this lane exists to prevent.
* **NEVER merge on `{PULL_REQUEST}` or `{BRANCH_ONLY}`.** Those two stop where they stop, and the director merge lane carries a `{PULL_REQUEST}` from there."""
