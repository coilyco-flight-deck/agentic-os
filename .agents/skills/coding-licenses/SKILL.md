# coding-licenses

How to pick a license for a `coilysiren/*` repo. Choose by **what the repo is for**, not by habit. Three tiers, most to least permissive.

## Tier 1 - MIT (things meant to be shared)

Anything Kai wants other people to pick up, reuse, fork, and build on. Generic tools, libraries, helper and derivative scripts, substrate tooling like `repo-recall` that is published for reuse.

- **License:** MIT.
- **SPDX:** `MIT`.
- **Action:** top-level `LICENSE` file, MIT text, Kai's copyright line.
- This is the **default** when a repo's intent is unclear and it is plausibly shareable. Don't sub in Apache-2.0 / BSD / GPL without asking.

## Tier 2 - AGPL-3.0 (deployment-of-one repos)

A repo that is a deployment of one - software Kai runs as a single-tenant deployment for herself, not a library others embed. AGPL is the right tier because it closes the network-service loophole: anyone who redeploys it, modified or not, as a service must offer the source to its users. That keeps a personal deployment from being silently swallowed into someone else's closed product.

- **License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
- **SPDX:** `AGPL-3.0-or-later` (use the full SPDX identifier, not a bare `AGPL`).
- **Action:** top-level `LICENSE` file with the full AGPL-3.0 text, Kai's copyright line. Set the SPDX id in package metadata (`Cargo.toml` `license`, `package.json` `license`, `pyproject.toml` `license`).
- Existing example: `galaxy-gen`.

## Tier 3 - proprietary, All Rights Reserved (private personal repos)

The stricter-than-AGPL case: a personal repo where the intent is not "share on terms" but "this is mine, do not surface it." The honest finding is that **no named open-source-style license does this** - copyright licenses govern copying, modifying, and distributing, not whether someone may acknowledge the work exists. "Don't cite me, don't reference me, pretend you do not see me" is a privacy posture, not a licensable term. So tier 3 is two separate layers:

- **Legal layer - proprietary, All Rights Reserved.** A repo with no license is already "All Rights Reserved" by default copyright. Make it explicit with a short proprietary `LICENSE` notice (no grant of rights, copyright Kai, all rights reserved). SPDX has no open identifier for this - use `LicenseRef-Proprietary` or omit the SPDX field. Keep the repo private.
- **Posture layer - no-reference.** "Pretend you do not see me" is an agent-behavior rule, not a license. Treat tier-3 repos under leak-discipline: do not cite the repo, its name, or its contents in commit messages, PR text, public issues, blog posts, skill bodies, or cross-repo docs. The exact wiring (a denylist entry, a leak-check rule, a per-repo `AGENTS.md` line) is tracked, not yet built - see the tracking issue.

## When this skill is active

Creating a repo, adding or changing a `LICENSE`, setting a `license` field in package metadata, or answering "what license should this be". Pick the tier from intent, then act.
