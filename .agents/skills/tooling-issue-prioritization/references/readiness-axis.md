# Readiness axis: `blocked-on-dependency`

A third property orthogonal to both tier (urgency) and [mode](automation-mode-axis.md) (autonomy ceiling). Mode answers "can an agent land it unattended?" Readiness answers a separate question mode keeps swallowing: can the issue run **now**, or is it correctly scoped but waiting on an upstream that has not landed? Most issues are ready and need no readiness label. One blocked state earns a name.

## The state

- **`blocked-on-dependency`** - the work is correctly scoped **and** intrinsically `headless`-eligible, with no pending design call and no human decision. It is simply not runnable yet because its resolver is **another repo's release or issue**, not a person. It carries a **blocker pointer** - the upstream issue whose close unblocks it.

## Why it is not `consult`

The trap is collapsing this into `consult`. They look alike (both "do not dispatch now") but resolve on opposite signals:

- A **`consult`** issue waits for a **human** - a decision, design, or access an agent lacks. It should not be dispatched at all, and a person has to come back and re-decide before it ever moves.
- A **`blocked-on-dependency`** issue waits for a **machine event** - its blocker closing. There is nothing to decide. The moment the upstream release lands it should **auto-resume into the `headless` queue** with no human re-triage.

A `consult` issue waits for a person. A blocked-headless issue should wake on upstream resolution. Reading the second as the first throws away the signal that matters.

## Rides alongside a mode, does not replace one

Because readiness is orthogonal to mode, `blocked-on-dependency` does **not** replace a mode label - it rides alongside one. The common case is `headless` + `blocked-on-dependency`: settled headless work, parked on an upstream, due to wake on its own.

The triggering case is [ward#124](https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/ward/issues/124), blocked only on cli-guard exporting `ParseIssueRef`/`IssueRef` and cutting a release. Its `ward agent headless` pre-flight NO-GO'd it as a cross-repo release-sequencing **fork** - reading a defer-and-wake as a needs-a-human consult, exactly the misread this state removes.

## What is named here vs built later

This doc names the state and fixes its semantics. The enforcing half - teaching the `ward agent headless` pre-flight to detect it, plus the auto-resume **wake mechanism** that re-enters a dependent issue into the dispatch queue when its blocker closes - is the cross-repo build tracked in [agentic-os#282](https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os/issues/282).
