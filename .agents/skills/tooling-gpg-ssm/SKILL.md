# gpg-ssm

GPG wrapper script that fetches signing material from AWS SSM at sign time, instead of caching it in Keychain or anywhere else on disk. Stolen-laptop scope is one key, not the whole identity.

## Files

- `~/projects/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os/scripts/gpg-ssm` - the wrapper (bash). Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/gpg-ssm` by the ansible shell role.
- `~/projects/coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os/scripts/gpg-ssm.cmd` - Windows shim for Git for Windows, which can't reliably invoke an extensionless shebang script. It's a `bash.exe` re-entry.

## Wire-up

```bash
git config --global gpg.program "$HOME/.local/bin/gpg-ssm"
```

Windows: same idea, point at `gpg-ssm.cmd`.

## Deeper context
