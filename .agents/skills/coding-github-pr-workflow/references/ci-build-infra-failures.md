# CI Build and Infra Failures

Build, permission, timeout, and container failure patterns, plus the auto-fix decision tree.

## Build / Compilation Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'some_package'
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement foo==1.2.3
npm ERR! Could not resolve dependency
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check requirements.txt / package.json for the missing or incompatible dependency
2. Compare local vs CI Python/Node version

**Common fixes:**
- Add missing dependency to requirements file
- Pin compatible version
- Update lockfile (`pip freeze`, `npm install`)

## Permission / Auth Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
Error: Resource not accessible by integration
403 Forbidden
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check if the workflow needs special permissions (token scopes)
2. Check if secrets are configured (missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` or custom secrets)

**Common fixes:**
- Add `permissions:` block to workflow YAML
- Verify secrets exist: `gh secret list` or check repo settings
- For fork PRs: some secrets aren't available by design

## Timeout Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
Error: The operation was canceled.
The job running on runner ... has exceeded the maximum execution time
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check which step timed out
2. Look for infinite loops, hung processes, or slow network calls

**Common fixes:**
- Add timeout to the specific step: `timeout-minutes: 10`
- Fix the underlying performance issue
- Split into parallel jobs

## Docker / Container Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
docker: Error response from daemon
failed to solve: ... not found
COPY failed: file not found in build context
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Check Dockerfile for the failing step
2. Verify the referenced files exist in the repo

**Common fixes:**
- Fix path in COPY/ADD command
- Update base image tag
- Add missing file to `.dockerignore` exclusion or remove from it

## Decision Tree and Re-running

- [Auto-fix decision tree and re-running](ci-decision-tree.md) - route a failure to its fix and recheck CI after pushing.
