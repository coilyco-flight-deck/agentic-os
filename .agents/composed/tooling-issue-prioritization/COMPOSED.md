description: Tier and prune an issue backlog, then drain the async-consult queue through batched AskUserQuestion rounds - priority/P0-P4, target ranges, percentile-cut assignment, an autonomy axis (headless, live-collab, async-consult, epic), and a role axis. Triggers - prioritize, triage the backlog, P0/P1/P2/P3/P4, icebox, burn down the backlog, autonomy, role labels, consult queue, ask the human, AskUserQuestion.

# Issue Prioritization

How to put a priority on every open issue and keep the backlog honest. Trackers without a native priority field express priority as per-issue labels `priority/P0` through `priority/P4` (exactly one per open issue) - agents apply them, humans sort and read. Define the labels once at org scope so every repo shares one set.

Three scoped axes ship - `priority/*`, `autonomy/*`, `role/*` - and the tracker enforces exclusivity on the first two. Write the full label name; the pre-2026-08-15 spellings match nothing. See [label-taxonomy](references/label-taxonomy.md).

Resolve ranking scope before labels. See
[pool rules](references/priority-pool.md).

## Primary loop: AskUserQuestion

**Every judgment only a human can make goes through AskUserQuestion, in batched rounds, written back to the tracker before the next round.** Tiering orders the backlog and the autonomy axis names each issue's ceiling, but neither moves anything on its own: `autonomy/async-consult` is a question waiting in a queue, and a queue nobody polls is just a label.

So this is the main loop, not a closing step - **the ranking exists to decide what to ask about next.** Read the issue and its comments before composing a question, because one the ticket already answers spends a round you do not get back.

Loop, option design, recording, and failure modes: [askuserquestion-flow](references/askuserquestion-flow.md).

## Tier definitions

- **`priority/P0`** - urgent AND blocking now. Active breakage/outage, security holes, data-loss risk, or blocks other committed work. Assigned by **a content-rule net, then a judgment confirm** (see Target shape), never a quota - whatever genuinely matches is P0.
- **`priority/P1`** - important, the clear next thing once P0s clear. Concrete, committed-direction, near-term value.
- **`priority/P2`** - backlog you genuinely intend to act on, just not yet. A real near-to-mid-term path to done.
- **`priority/P3`** - the DEFAULT tier. Low but kept; also where unsure, unscored, or freshly-filed issues land. Requires no positive evidence - it is the fallback.
- **`priority/P4`** - icebox, the lowest tier. The demotion sink: parked / speculative-but-kept / won't-do-soon (hobby toys, "fork X" / "try Z" wishes, reading-list adds, vague vision, far-future plays, one-line stubs). Unlike `priority/P3`, `priority/P4` needs positive "parked" judgment - the async triage loop pushes here rather than closing.

## Target shape

`priority/P0` has no quota - it is content-based, carved by a deterministic
content-rule net and then a per-candidate judgment confirm. The non-P0
remainder splits across the resolved pool into equal-width bands. Both the
rules and the bands live in [target-shape](references/target-shape.md).

## Second axis: autonomy

Tier ranks urgency, not "can an agent land it unattended?" - independent questions. A second orthogonal axis labels each issue `autonomy/headless`, `autonomy/live-collab`, `autonomy/async-consult`, or `autonomy/epic`, the agent-autonomy ceiling it is cleared for; unlabeled and unsure both fail-closed to `autonomy/async-consult`. See [automation-mode-axis](references/automation-mode-axis.md). The rounds above are how that queue drains, and `role/*` says whose queue it is.

## Third axis: role

Which seat the work needs, orthogonal to both others and not exclusive. Eight values, one per role, plus `role/human` for a person who is not a seat at all. It answers what `autonomy/async-consult` kept swallowing - a human is needed, but **which** one. See [label-taxonomy](references/label-taxonomy.md).

## Assignment, pruning, and running it over an API

- [Assignment method](references/assignment-method.md) - the part that actually works: carve P0 by rule, score the rest by judgment, enforce the shape by percentile cut.
- [Pruning and running it over an API](references/pruning-and-api.md) - demote/merge/close decisions plus the hard-won lessons for driving triage over an issue tracker API.
