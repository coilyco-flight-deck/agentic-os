# Create the tracker issues

For each approved slice, create an issue through the repository's configured
tracker surface. Coilyco repositories use Forgejo. Follow
`kai-git-workflow` for tracker selection and write authority.

Create issues in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real issue numbers in the "Blocked by" field.

<issue-template>
## Parent

#<parent-issue-number> (if the source was an issue, otherwise omit this section)

## What to build

A concise description of this vertical slice. Describe the end-to-end behavior, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Blocked by

- Blocked by #<issue-number> (if any)

Or "None - can start immediately" if no blockers.

</issue-template>

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.
