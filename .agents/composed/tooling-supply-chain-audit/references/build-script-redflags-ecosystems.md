# Build script red flags: npm, Python, Go, features

Continues [build-script-redflags.md](build-script-redflags.md) for non-Rust ecosystems.

## npm: `scripts.preinstall` / `install` / `postinstall`

Run on `npm install` / `pnpm install` / `yarn install` of **any** downstream consumer. Read these from `package.json`.

### Normal

- Running a known build tool: `node-gyp rebuild`, `tsc`, `vite build`
- Setting permissions on bundled binaries: `chmod +x ./bin/foo`
- Generating types from a schema

### Red flags

- `curl ... | sh` / `wget ... | bash` - pipe-to-shell from anywhere. Always red.
- Downloading binaries from non-publisher domains.
- Writing to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, `~/.zshrc`, or any global config.
- Reading `~/.npmrc`, `~/.aws/`, `~/.ssh/`, env tokens.
- Encoded blobs decoded then exec'd (the eslint-scope / event-stream pattern).
- Posting to a remote endpoint with hostname/user info "for telemetry" - even when benign, this is the typosquat attacker's exfil path.

## Python: `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` build hooks

Modern projects favor `pyproject.toml` and a build backend (`setuptools`, `hatchling`, `flit`, `poetry-core`, `pdm-backend`) over a custom `setup.py`. A custom `setup.py` with non-trivial code is itself a yellow flag (rare in well-maintained projects); read every line.

Pip can run arbitrary code at install via:

- `setup.py` top-level statements
- A custom build backend that does anything beyond reading/writing source files
- Entry-point scripts auto-installed into the user's PATH (`[project.scripts]`)

Red flags:

- `subprocess.run(["sh", "-c", ...])` in setup.py
- Network calls in setup.py outside of a documented "compile a known artifact" path
- `__import__` of unusual names
- Writes to `~/.config/`, `~/.local/`, `/etc/`

## Go: `go:generate` and `init()`

Go is mostly safe-by-default at build time (the `go build` toolchain doesn't run user code), but watch for:

- `go:generate` directives that shell out to non-standard tools. These run on `go generate`, not `go build`, but contributors often run both.
- `init()` functions in published packages that do anything beyond simple registration. Init runs on `import`, in any consumer.

## Cargo features that hide build behavior

Some malicious crates have hidden their payload behind a non-default feature. The audit baseline is: read the crate as if every feature were enabled. If a feature called `experimental` or `unstable` does network IO at build time, document that, even if the consumer won't enable it.

## Quick command set

```sh
# List all build.rs in a Rust workspace
gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/git/trees/<branch>?recursive=1 --jq '.tree[] | select(.path | endswith("build.rs")) | .path'

# Read each
for path in $(...); do
  gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/contents/$path --jq '.content' | base64 -d
done

# List proc-macro crates in workspace
grep -lA1 "proc-macro = true" $(find . -name Cargo.toml)

# npm install hooks
gh api repos/<owner>/<name>/contents/package.json --jq '.content' | base64 -d \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; s=json.load(sys.stdin).get('scripts',{}); [print(k,'->',v) for k,v in s.items() if 'install' in k]"
```
