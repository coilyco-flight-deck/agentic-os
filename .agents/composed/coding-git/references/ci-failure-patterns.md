# CI Failure Patterns

Common CI failure patterns and how to diagnose them from the logs.

## Reading CI Logs

```bash
# With gh
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed

# With curl - download and extract
curl -sL -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/$GH_OWNER/$GH_REPO/actions/runs/<RUN_ID>/logs \
  -o /tmp/ci-logs.zip && unzip -o /tmp/ci-logs.zip -d /tmp/ci-logs
```

## Test Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
FAILED tests/test_foo.py::test_bar - AssertionError
E       assert 42 == 43
ERROR tests/test_foo.py - ModuleNotFoundError
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Find the test file and line number from the traceback
2. Use `read_file` to read the failing test
3. Check if it's a logic error in the code or a stale test assertion
4. Look for `ModuleNotFoundError` - usually a missing dependency in CI

**Common fixes:**
- Update assertion to match new expected behavior
- Add missing dependency to requirements.txt / pyproject.toml
- Fix flaky test (add retry, mock external service, fix race condition)

## Lint / Formatting Failures

**Signatures in logs:**
```
src/auth.py:45:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, got 1
src/models.py:12:80: E501 line too long (95 > 88 characters)
error: would reformat src/utils.py
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Read the specific file:line numbers mentioned
2. Check which linter is complaining (flake8, ruff, black, isort, mypy)

**Common fixes:**
- Run the formatter locally: `black .`, `isort .`, `ruff check --fix .`
- Fix the specific style violation by editing the file
- If using `patch`, make sure to match existing indentation style

## Type Check Failures (mypy / pyright)

**Signatures in logs:**
```
src/api.py:23: error: Argument 1 to "process" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
src/models.py:45: error: Missing return statement
```

**Diagnosis:**
1. Read the file at the mentioned line
2. Check the function signature and what's being passed

**Common fixes:**
- Add type cast or conversion
- Fix the function signature
- Add `# type: ignore` comment as last resort (with explanation)
