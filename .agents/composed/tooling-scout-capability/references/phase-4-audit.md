# Phase 4 - Security audit (🥈 and 🥇 only)

**BLOCKED ON the execution verification step.** The audit rubric below is provisional. Phase 4 has
been red-flagging third-party MCPs that overlap a ward wrapper (Cloudflare,
GitHub, k8s, Tailscale, AWS, Discord-admin) on ward-bypass grounds, but
mcporter is the actual execution path and may itself be the audit choke
point. Once mcporter execution is verified, revise this rubric:
🔴 should narrow to real supply-chain audit failures (malicious code,
abandoned projects, anonymous maintainers writing privileged tools),
not "duplicates a ward wrapper." Until then, treat the ward-overlap
red flag with skepticism and surface the call to the user instead of
auto-rejecting.

For every 🥈 and 🥇 entry, run `coding-core-supply-chain-audit`. 🥉 entries are
skipped because they will not be installed.

When PM owns the scout, PM hands the candidate packet to engineer or ops for
this phase. The execution role returns the verdict and evidence. PM records
that result and resumes the portfolio decision.

Map results to a `🟢🟡🔴` prefix:

- 🔴 - audit failed (suspicious maintainer, malicious code patterns,
  abandoned/unmaintained, dependency-confusion-style risk, or zero
  downstream adoption with high-privilege scope). 🔴 entries are never
  installed regardless of any later approval.
- 🟡 - audit passed but the domain is theoretically dangerous (banking,
  payments, cloud-write, secrets handling, code execution, browser
  automation against authenticated sessions). Cautious-by-domain even
  when the implementation is clean.
- 🟢 - audit passed and the domain is benign (read-only catalog, public
  APIs, narrow-scope data fetchers, documentation tooling, file format
  conversion).

Speculative entries (no code to audit) get 🟡 by default since "I'd ask
someone about it" is not "I'd install it tomorrow."

Output: `YYYY-MM-DD-capability-scout-4-audited.yaml`. Preserve the
medal emoji; prepend the safety emoji. Final per-entry prefix shape:
`{category-emoji}{medal}{safety} ` followed by `Category / Org / Name /
Url / Description`.
