# Skill authoring

Director and PM use this method to decide whether a capability deserves a
skill, where it belongs, and what contract an implementation role receives.
When repository changes are required, the active role hands the bounded source
change to engineer rather than transferring this whole catalog.

## Handbook

Start with [skill admission](references/admission.md) and
[placement](references/placement.md). Structural rules live in the
[handbook](references/handbook.md), drafting procedure in the
[authoring walkthrough](references/authoring-walkthrough.md), and shaped
sources in [`templates/`](templates/).

This entrypoint carries the highest-frequency authoring discipline.

## Location

Ordinary skills live at `<provider-repo>/.agents/skills/`. They use `SKILL.md`
and form the harness-discoverable surface.

Role-scoped sources live at `<provider-repo>/.agents/composed/`. They use
`COMPOSED.md`, bind in `.agents/roles.kdl`, and become `SKILL.md` only after
agent-compose selects the role. Never place `SKILL.md` under `.agents/composed/`.

Per-repo co-location is only for design or usage reference scoped to that repo.
Runbooks and partial-failure playbooks stay central. Requirements live in
[`references/co-location.md`](references/co-location.md).

## Authoring

Create an ordinary source with `SKILL.md`, or a role-scoped source with
`COMPOSED.md`. Both use the same `name` and `description` frontmatter. Bind
each role-scoped source in `.agents/roles.kdl`.

Classify low-context admission per skill. Missing metadata defaults to
`required`. See the [model-class policy](../../../docs/skill-model-classes.md).

Run the validator before committing for fast feedback:

```sh
pre-commit run skill-conventions --all-files
pre-commit run dead-cross-links --all-files
pre-commit run em-dash-check --all-files
```

The structural validators enforce the category taxonomy from
`.agents/skills/categories.yaml`. `check-skills` covers ordinary sources.
`check-composed-skills` covers role-scoped sources and their isolation.

## Opinionated discipline

Decision reasoning for these rules lives in
[`references/opinionated-discipline.md`](references/opinionated-discipline.md):

- **Encode why** - preserve reasoning across fresh sessions.
- **Keep sources flat** - every source is a peer directory.
- **Use deterministic helpers** - scripts parse and transform, models synthesize.

Description budgets and router exceptions live in
[`references/frontmatter-aliases.md`](references/frontmatter-aliases.md).

## Extended discipline

Extended rules for runbooks, plugins, and documentation live in
[`references/discipline.md`](references/discipline.md).
