# To Issues

Break a plan into independently-grabbable tracker issues using vertical slices
(tracer bullets).

## Process

### 0. Size-check (only on oversized-opener path)

If this skill fired because the session opened with a bare issue reference,
read it through the repository's configured tracker surface and assess size
before doing anything else:

- Single, narrow acceptance criterion - not oversized. Decline politely, hand control back, let the normal flow run.
- Multiple unrelated acceptance criteria, vague scope, or estimated to touch many files across layers - oversized. Tell the user you flagged it as oversized and ask if they want to split before executing. If yes, continue to step 1. If no, hand control back.

The point of this gate is to avoid splitting issues that don't need it. The skill is the right tool when an issue would otherwise burn a whole session on orientation plus mid-task compaction.

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the human passes
an issue number or URL, read the issue and comments through the repository's
configured tracker surface.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code.

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the plan into **tracer bullet** issues. Each issue is a thin vertical slice that cuts through ALL integration layers end-to-end, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer.

Slices may be 'HITL' or 'AFK'. HITL slices require human interaction, such as an architectural decision or a design review. AFK slices can be implemented and merged without human interaction. Prefer AFK over HITL where possible.

<vertical-slice-rules>
- Each slice delivers a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests)
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Prefer many thin slices over few thick ones
</vertical-slice-rules>

### 4. Quiz the human

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each slice, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Type**: HITL / AFK
- **Blocked by**: which other slices (if any) must complete first
- **User stories covered**: which user stories this addresses (if the source material has them)

Ask the human:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the dependency relationships correct?
- Should any slices be merged or split further?
- Are the correct slices marked as HITL and AFK?

Iterate until the human approves the breakdown.

### 5. Create the tracker issues
