# coding-core-git

Umbrella skill for any work that touches git or GitHub. Owns the broad keyword surface, carries the hard rules that apply to every GitHub touch, holds the full pull-request lifecycle inline, and routes to the focused siblings for ward passthrough and the `coilysiren/*` commit rules.

## Triggers

git, github, gh, gh cli, gh api, octokit, graphql, repo, repository, pull request, PR, issue, fork, branch, commit, push, workflow, action, release, tag, label.

## Hard rule: never use the GitHub GraphQL API without confirming first

Never reach for the GitHub GraphQL API (`gh api graphql`, `octokit.graphql`, raw POSTs to `/graphql`, etc.) without double-confirming with Kai first. State that the proposed approach uses GraphQL, name a REST alternative if one exists, and wait for an explicit go-ahead before running or writing the call.

Applies to one-off commands, scripts, workflows, skills, and any code Kai will run.

**Why:** GraphQL rate limits have burned three days of Kai's time. The recovery is slow and annoying, and the burn is silent until limits hit.

**How to apply:** default to REST (`gh api /repos/...`, search endpoints, list endpoints) and accept the extra round-trips. REST rate limits are far more forgiving and the failure mode is per-call, not per-account.

## Pull request lifecycle

Each step shows the `gh` way first, then the `git` + `curl` fallback for machines without `gh`. Detect which to use once up front (`gh auth status` succeeds -> `gh`, else extract `owner/repo` from the remote and use a token for REST calls).

- [Monitoring CI status](references/monitoring-ci.md) - one-shot checks, watch mode, and a curl polling loop.
- [Auto-fixing CI failures](references/auto-fixing-ci.md) - diagnose, fix, push, recheck. Cap at 3 attempts before asking.

## Routing

- **Ward passthrough for `gh`** (audit-log binding, scope routing) - `ward-ops-gh-meta` (in ward).
- **Git workflow for `coilysiren/*` repos** (commit-to-main default, every-commit-closes-an-issue rule, readonly exceptions) - `coding-core-git-workflow`.
