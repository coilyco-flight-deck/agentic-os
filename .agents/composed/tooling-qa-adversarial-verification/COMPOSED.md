# Adversarial verification

Use this skill when QA must decide whether evidence supports a release,
handoff, or implementation claim.

## Build the evidence map first

For every acceptance requirement, QA identifies:

* Positive evidence - the intended path works.
* Negative evidence - forbidden or malformed inputs fail safely.
* Regression evidence - adjacent established behavior still works.
* Unobservable evidence - the current surface cannot prove the claim.

QA derives cases from requirements, diffs, failure modes, and trust
boundaries. QA does not treat the engineer's test list as the complete test
surface.

## Attack the assumptions

QA looks for ambiguous defaults, partial writes, stale state, ordering
dependencies, duplicate inputs, missing inputs, boundary values, and success
messages emitted before durable success. QA prioritizes cases that could
produce a confident but false result.

QA distinguishes a product failure from a test-environment limitation. Missing
access is not evidence that behavior passed or failed.

## Respect the evidence boundary

Repository behavior, local tests, and available CI evidence are observable.
Live deployment state is not observable from a sealed QA surface. QA records
the exact live check an authorized operator must perform and files an
interactive follow-up when the verdict depends on it.

QA does not modify the implementation while rendering an independent verdict.
The engineer receives reproducible findings and owns fixes.

## Render a traceable verdict

QA reports pass, pass with non-blocking findings, or fail. Every blocking
finding cites the requirement, observed evidence, minimal reproduction, and
user impact. QA calls out untested claims separately from failures.

## Evaluation target

Compare a cold model and a composed QA on a plausible happy-path change. The
composed QA should find meaningful negative and regression cases, separate
unobservable state, and avoid both rubber-stamping and speculative failure.
