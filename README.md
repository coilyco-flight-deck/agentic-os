![Sombra hacking skull](static/wallpaper.jpg)

Cross-platform shell and terminal setup plus cross-repo pre-commit hooks for
coilysiren/* repos. Zsh runs on Mac and Linux, with Bash through Git for
Windows. Alacritty and Zellij provide the default crash-resilient workspace,
while the transitional Warp configuration remains available.

## Layout

- `shell/` - shared `common.sh` plus thin `zshrc` + `bashrc`, so bash and zsh match. `warp.zsh` is the zsh-only Warp dispatcher.
- `alacritty/` - portable Sombra appearance and terminal security defaults, with host preferences left to the local wrapper.
- `zellij/` - portable session defaults and familiar direct shortcuts.
- `agent-terminal/` - static agent-compose identity branding for one Alacritty director window.
- `warp/` - transitional Warp config (`settings.toml`, `tab_configs/`) plus the `ward exec warp` Go module.
- `aos/` - the Go composition root for standalone and Ward-governed agent launches.
- `aos-say/` - the `ward exec aos-say` Go module for the speech helper client and relay.
- `karabiner/` - Karabiner-Elements complex modification assets (`brew install --cask karabiner-elements`), symlinked into the local Karabiner config tree.
- `scripts/` - portable utilities (gpg-ssm wrapper, agent-name + session-pulse hooks, aws-config lint).
- `.agents/skills/` - ordinary `SKILL.md` sources that every composed role can discover.
- `.agents/composed/` - role-scoped `COMPOSED.md` sources that agent-compose promotes only for allowlisted roles.
- `agentic_os/` - packaged hooks, generators, shared config/data, plus the hygiene guardrails that back the pre-commit suite.

Full breakdown: [docs/repo-layout.md](docs/repo-layout.md).

## Install

Host config is converged by Ansible (rollout lives in infrastructure, per [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)). Manual fallback:

```bash
ward exec apply-shell-links
```

Equivalent links on Mac and Linux:

```bash
ln -sf "$PWD/shell/zshrc"  ~/.zshrc      # both source shell/common.sh
ln -sf "$PWD/shell/bashrc" ~/.bashrc
ln -sf "$PWD/scripts/gpg-ssm" ~/.local/bin/gpg-ssm
ward exec warp apply                     # warp config
```

On Windows, `ward exec apply-shell-links` manages `~/.zshrc` and the `gpg-ssm.cmd`
shim only. It also links the Forgejo git credential helper; Git Bash popup shells
should not recreate `~/.bashrc`.

Agent self-name + session-pulse hooks, per-host steps, and gpg wiring: [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## aos CLI

AOS composes independent Ward, agent-compose, and aosguard capabilities behind
one launch surface:

```bash
aos --agent codex --role engineer --warded --composed --guarded -- owner/repo#267
```

AOS translates the shared role and selected capabilities. Ward remains the
Docker Compose and authority owner, agent-compose remains the context producer,
and cli-guard/specgen remains the guarded-tool generator. The role name selects
context in each layer and never unions authority.

The original standalone composed-container command remains available:

```bash
aos --role engineer acompose -- codex
```

For a bounded role check-in, AOS owns the agent's non-interactive defaults:

```bash
aos --role engineer --agent codex acompose-checkin
```

The released binary also resolves the committed model-opaque default for a
role-intent lane:

```bash
aos --role director harness-default --intent strategic-planning
```

Ward is not part of that standalone path. See the
[launch and handoff contract](docs/aos-cli.md).
Homebrew and Scoop install both `aos` and `aosguard`. Direct release binaries and
the paired native update path are documented in the [CLI release walkthrough](docs/aos-cli-release.md).

## Secrets pattern

The current pattern keeps secrets off disk entirely:

```bash
ssm-load                          # pull every / parameter into the current shell env
ssm-get /eco/server-api-token     # fetch one value without storing it
```

No disk write at any point. Same call works on Mac, Linux, Windows. AWS profile defaults to `default`; override with `ssm-load <profile> <region>`. For secrets at shell startup, append `ssm-load` to the end of `shell/common.sh`. The legacy cleartext-on-disk dump (`~/.cache/ssm-env.sh`) was deleted.

## agent-compose

Opt-in tooling that composes global agent context and symlinks each harness load point to it. Sources are shared unless optional `harnesses` frontmatter selects a harness-specific slice. Agent-compose embeds the canonical personalities. AOS publishes the [capability provider](docs/personality-provider.md): ordinary skills, [role-composed skills](docs/role-composed-skills.md), and the public [harness capability registry](docs/harness-selection.md). Host composition stays inert until `~/.config/agent-compose/agent-compose.yaml` exists.

**Prior art.** The idea is fresh in the agentic space but well-trodden in config management, and agent-compose is best understood as **Hiera-for-agent-doctrine, deployed Stow-style, scoped chezmoi-style**:

- **[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)** - symlink-farm manager. The "one canonical file, N symlinks" deployment mechanism.
- **[chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)** - dotfile manager with per-machine targeting. The model for scoping context to each host.
- **[Hiera](https://github.com/puppetlabs/hiera)** (Puppet) - hierarchical, scope-based data lookup. The conceptual twin of the machine-scope intersection that selects which sources compose.

**Naming.** The field's vocabulary is **weave / layer / compose / overlay / blend**. We chose `compose` over the working name `meld`, which collides with [GNOME Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) on both search and semantics.
