// aterm resolves a seat, a roster, and an overlay by shelling out before it

// `aos` that converges the host first, a cold catalogue read, a stalled fetch.
// The launcher captures their output, so a slow call used to present as a
// terminal that had simply stopped. Naming what is being waited on is the whole
// fix: it turns "stuck?" into a process tree anyone can go read.
